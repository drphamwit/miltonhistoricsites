# Milton Historic Sites
Mobile app for Milton historic sites

## Introduction

The Milton Historic Commission is working to expand the city's commitment to historic preservation by identifying, researching, and requesting historic district designation for several areas. Their main goal is to generate public enthusiasm about Milton's history. We would like to develop a mobile application that allows users to create geolocated entries for various historical sites and allows the importation of documents, images, videos, and other media. We aim to offer a low cost of maintenance solution for cities and make it accessible to everyone. This model, if successful, could be replicated to other cities for people to learn and appreciate the deep and fascinating history of those cities around the US.
